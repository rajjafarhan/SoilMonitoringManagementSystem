<h1>Soil Moisture Monitoring System</h1>
<h2>Scope:</h2>
The Soil Moisture Monitoring System (SMMS) is an advanced, automated system engineered to meticulously manage and maintain the soil moisture within critical thresholds in various agricultural settings, including greenhouses, open fields, and urban farming installations. The system's primary function is to ensure that the soil remains within an optimal moisture range, which is crucial for the health and yield of crops. To achieve this, the SMMS is equipped with a network of high-precision soil moisture sensors that provide real-time data on the soil's current moisture content.
Upon installation, the user configures the system by setting the desired soil moisture range. This range is typically expressed as a percentage of volumetric water content (VWC), where 0% VWC means completely dry soil and 100% VWC indicates full water saturation. For most agricultural applications, the optimal VWC range is between 20% and 60%, where 20% may represent the lower threshold (minimum desired moisture level) and 60% the upper threshold (maximum desired moisture level). 
When the Soil Moisture Monitoring System ( SMMS) detects that the soil moisture has fallen below the 20% threshold, it sends a signal to the irrigation control unit to initiate watering(INCREASE)), thereby increasing the VWC towards the desired level. If the system detects a moisture content above the 60% threshold , it signals the irrigation system to cease watering (DECREASE), preventing waterlogging and potential root damage due to excessive moisture. Should the soil moisture be within the 20-60% range, the system will send a 'maintain' signal, indicating that the current moisture level is adequate and no adjustment is needed.
The system's user interface allows for remote monitoring and control, granting the user the ability to adjust settings and receive alerts on the go. Alerts can be configured to notify the user when the soil moisture levels are outside of the predetermined range or when system anomalies are detected.
The SMMS represents a significant step forward in precision agriculture, offering a robust solution for optimizing water usage, enhancing crop health, and ultimately increasing agricultural efficiency and productivity.
